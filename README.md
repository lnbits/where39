# Where39 - An [LNbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits) Extension

## For Dead Drops, Burying Treasure, or Just Sharing Your Location with Friends Privately

Any3Words is good, but it's not private. Where39 is a BIP39 location protocol that you can run yourself.  
- Useful for dead drops, burying treasure, or just sharing your location with friends.  
- By running your own Where39 server, you can ensure that your location data is not being shared with anyone.
