For dead drops and burying treasure

Any3Words is good, but it's not private. Where39 is a BIP39 location protocol that you can run yourself.

Where39 is useful for dead drops, burying treasure, or just sharing your location with friends. By running your own Where39 server, you can be sure that your location data is not shared with anyone.
